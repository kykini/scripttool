**FADE IN:**

A low slung industrial building in an industrial center. 
The last car leaves the lot. Parking lot lights switch off.

CROSSFADE TO:

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

A PROGRAMMER stares at the screen.

PROGRAMMER
(drowsy)
What algorithm is this?

CUT TO:

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

A programmer lounges by a fountain.

PROGRAMMER
(drowsy)
This is what I remember.

FADE TO BLACK.
