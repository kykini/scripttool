.FADE IN

A low slung industrial building in an industrial center. 
The last car leaves the lot.

CUT TO:

INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

A PROGRAMMER stares at the screen.

PROGRAMMER
(drowsy)
What was that algorithm?

CUT TO:

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

A programmer lounges by a fountain.

PROGRAMMER
(drowsy)
This is what I remember.
